# Cracking the coding interview book exercises
Solutions to the "Cracking the coding interview" book exercises.

These are the coding exercises done in C++ to help me prepare for the internship or job interview to come. I am solving the exercises from the fourth edition of the book.

All examples can be run using the following command:
```
g++ -Wall exercise.cpp -o exercise.exe
.\exercise.exe
```

Feel free to comment, so that we both can (hopefully) benefit from it!
